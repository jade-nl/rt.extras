## Local Adjustments profiles

- la.empty.pp3

  Remove all spots present. I only use this one in combination with the *rtsm.sh* script due to a peculiar loading issue when loading a partial profile in the Local Adjustments module (see script for more details about this).

- border-coloured.pp3
- border-white.pp3

  Create a white or coloured border. Just a fun  novelty.
