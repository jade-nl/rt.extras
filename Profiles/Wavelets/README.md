## Wavelet levels profiles

- base.01.set.edge.res.pp3

Sets a sane starting point for both *Edge Sharpness* and *Residual Image* and changes the following begin points in the *Wavelet Settings* section:

* Edge performance: *D10 - medium*
* Starting level: *Level 1*

These *Wavelet Settings* are sane(r) starting points and need to be adjusted to reflect the RAW used.
