## B&W profiles

Some B&W starting points. These go on top of a technically correct base edit.

These 2 are a dramatic and a softer looking starting point. The wl versions add a little extra contrast if needed.

* bw.01_lab_cm_tm.pp3
* bw.01_lab_cm_tm.wl.pp3

* bw.02_ct_tm.pp3
* bw.02_ct_tm_wl.pp3

These 3 are skin oriented. First one is blue based and although somewhat harsher might be a good starting point for a low(er) key edit. The third one is red based and a good starting point for high(er) key edits. The middle (neutral) one uses Wavelets, make sure to adjust this to accomadate your camera.

* bw.skin_01.harsher.pp3 - bw
* bw.skin_02.neutral.pp3 - bw + wl + sl
* bw.skin_03.softer.pp3  - bw

As with all profiles, or styles if you want, these need to be tuned in to the image they are applied to. This is true in general but especially so for the wl versions.

```
bw  -> Black-and-White
cm  -> Channel Mixer
ct  -> Colour Toning
lab -> L*a*b Adjustments
sl  -> Soft Light
tm  -> Tone Mapping
wl  -> Wavelet Levels
```
