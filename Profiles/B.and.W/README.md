## B&W profiles

Some B&W starting points.

These 2 are a dramatic and a softer looking starting point. The wl versions add a little extra contrast if needed.

* bw.01_lab_cm_tm.pp3
* bw.01_lab_cm_tm.wl.pp3

* bw.02_ct_tm.pp3
* bw.02_ct_tm_wl.pp3

These 2 are skin oriented. First one is blue based and although somewhat harsher might be a good starting point for a low(er) key edit. The second one is red based and a good starting point for high(er) key edits.

* bw.skin_01.harsher.pp3
* bw.skin_02.softer.pp3

As with all profiles, or styles if you want, these need to be tuned in to the image they are applied to. This is true in general but especially so for the wl versions.

```
cm  -> Channel Mixer
ct  -> Colour Toning
lab -> L*a*b Adjustments
tm  -> Tone Mapping
wl  -> Wavelet Levels
```
