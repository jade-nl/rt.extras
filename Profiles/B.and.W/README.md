## B&W profiles

Some B&W starting points.

* bw.01_lab_tm.pp3
* bw.01_lab_tm_wl.pp3

* bw.02_ct_tm.pp3
* bw.02_ct_tm_wl.pp3

* bw.03_lab_cm_tm.pp3
* bw.03_lab_cm_tm.wl.pp3

These 2 are skin oriented. First one is blue based and although somewhat harsher might be a good starting point for a low(er) key edit. The second one is red based and a good starting point for high(er) key edits.

* bw.skin_01.harsher.pp3
