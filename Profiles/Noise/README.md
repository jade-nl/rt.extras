# Noise profiles

A set of noise profiles created for the Nikon Z6II. These are meant as a good starting point.

Depending on the ISO level the following modules can be effected by these profiles:

- Demosaicing
- Capture Sharpening
- Impulse Noise Reduction
- Noise Reduction
- Sharpening

The *Denoise and Refine* and *Edge sharpness* tools from the *Wavelets levels* module are not included in these profiles. Too many factors come into play to set a sane baseline.

Not sure if these are useful for other Nikon Z series cameras. Let me know if they are(n't).
