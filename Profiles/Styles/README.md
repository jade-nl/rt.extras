## Styles

These are some styles that can be put on top of a technically corrected edit.

- rgb_lab_exp.base.01.pp3

  Baseline style using *RGB Curves*, *L\*a\*b Adjustments* and *Exposure*

- rgb_wavelet.exp.base.01.pp3

  Baseline style using *RGB Curves*, *Wavelet Levels* and *Exposure*

The above styles are starting points and need to be tuned/adjusted after applying them. Best results are reached if the RAW is first edited to be technically correct. So make sure that, among other things, at least the exposure is set and the WB is set to as neutral as possible.

Minimal way to apply one of the above Styles would be:
- Load RAW,
- Apply base.profile.pp3 (assuming this isn't don't automatically),
- Set exposure,
- Set Whit Balance,
- Apply style,
- Adjust to your liking.
