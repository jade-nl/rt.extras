## Toning

Colour Toning starting point profiles.

These 3 don't make any changes. They set multiple instances in the Colour Toning module:

* ct.base.smh.pp3

This sets up 3 instances that makes it easier to target shadows, midtones and highlights. The Luminance channel and mask blur is used for this profile.

* ct.base.rgb.pp3

This sets up 3 instances that makes it easier to target the reds, greens and blues. All three channels (hue, chromaticity and luminance) as well as mask blur are used in this profile.

* ct.base.all.pp3

This profiles combines the above 2 profiles and adds one extra instance that protects the deeper shadows and upper highlights via the luminance channel.
